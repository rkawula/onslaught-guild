== TODO

Vagrantfile: bundler wasn't properly installed through chef, had to 'gem install bundler' once inside the VM. Need to test if this requires a fix or if it was a one-off bug.

Currently, after using 'vagrant up', you still need to run 'sudo apt-get install libpq-dev', then 'gem install pg'.

Also 'sudo apt-get install postgresql'.

Then 'sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb vagrant'
